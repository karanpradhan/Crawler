<h1>Recursive Descent Parsing</h1>
<p><i>Parsing,</i> you will recall, is the process of turning a stream of tokens 
  into an abstract syntax tree. Any parsing technique requires a <i>grammar</i>--a 
  formal, detailed definition of what sequence of symbols constitutes a syntactically 
  correct program. Grammars are usually defined in BNF notation, which we will 
  explore shortly.</p>
<p>For industrial-strength compilers, parsers are usually written in the <code>yacc</code> 
  (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) formalism. <code>Yacc</code> is a program that 
  reads a BNF-like grammar, creates the abstract syntax tree, <i>and</i> produces 
  object code. <code>Yacc</code> is very powerful, but also quite complex, and 
  there are subtle, difficult-to-understand constraints on the BNF that can be 
  used.</p>
<p>Recursive descent parsing is an alternative to using <code>yacc</code>. Whereas 
  yacc reads BNF and produces a parser, recursive descent is a technique for doing 
  the same thing manually. That is, once you have the BNF for a language, you 
  can apply cookbook rules to write a parser that implements the BNF. With a little 
  practice, you can turn BNF into code almost as fast as you can type.</p>
<p>Recursive descent does have some drawbacks. While it is easy to detect syntax 
  errors and produce error messages, it is more of a challenge to produce error 
  messages that are helpful to the user. The typical error message simply tells 
  what token was found, and the set of token types that would have been legal 
  in that position.</p>
<h2>Turning BNF into code</h2>
<p>We will discuss first the simpler problem of <i>recognizing</i> a sequence 
  of tokens. Recognition is like parsing, except that no parse tree is built. 
  Instead, the result of recognition is a simple boolean value: <code>true</code> 
  if the input stream is a syntactically correct program, and <code>false</code> 
  otherwise. Turning a recognizer into a parser is simply a matter of adding tree-building 
  code to each method, and returning the tree rather than a boolean value.</p>
<p>Each nonterminal in the BNF is represented by a single method (or function,
   if you are using a non-object-oriented language) in the recursive descent
  parser.  Typically, the current token is passed in as a parameter, though it
  may instead  be maintained as a global variable. We will assume a <code>Token</code> type,
   with accessible fields <code>type</code> (containing a flag that indicates
   to  which of several categories the token belongs) and <code>value</code> (containing
    the actual characters that make up the token). We will further assume that
   we have a <code>Tokenizer</code> class with a method <code>nextToken()</code> to get the
   next Token from some input stream. </p>
<p>When a method for a nonterminal succeeds, it should &quot;consume&quot; (use 
  up) exactly those tokens that constitute the nonterminal. If the method fails 
  (does not recognize the expected nonterminal), it should return without consuming 
  any tokens--this may involve &quot;putting back&quot; some tokens. Failure is 
  not, in general, an error, since we may need to test for several nonterminals 
  before finding the correct one.</p>
<h3>Delegation</h3>
<p>The very simplest BNF rules are those that define a nonterminal as identical 
  to another nonterminal. For example, we might define a &lt;variable&gt; as being 
  identical to a &lt;name&gt;. This yields the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>boolean variable(Token tok) {
    return name(Token tok);
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost as simple is the case where a nonterminal is defined as consisting of 
  a single terminal, for example, if &lt;less than&gt; is defined as &quot;&lt;&quot;. 
  This requires that the next token be used and compared to the desired token.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>boolean lessThan(Token tok) {
	return tok.value.equals(&quot;&lt;&quot;);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>A BNF rule may define alternative definitions for a nonterminal. For example,</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;operator&gt; ::= &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot; | &quot;*&quot; | &quot;/&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is handled by testing for each alternative in turn, and returning true 
  as soon as any alternative is satisfied, or false if none are satisfied.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>boolean operator(Token tok) {
    if (tok.value.equals(&quot;+&quot;)) return true;
    if (tok.value.equals(&quot;-&quot;)) return true;
    if (tok.value.equals(&quot;*&quot;)) return true;
    if (tok.value.equals(&quot;/&quot;)) return true;
    return false;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sequencing</h3>
<p>Some BNF rules consist of a simple sequence of terminals and nonterminals. 
  If it were not for the need to return a boolean result, we could implement this 
  with a simple sequence of method calls. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;assignment&gt; ::= &lt;variable&gt; &quot;=&quot; &lt;expression&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>could <i>almost</i> be coded as</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>boolean assignment(Token tok) {
    variable(tok);
    equalsSign(tok);
    expression(tok);
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several problems with this. First, of course, the method has to return 
  a boolean to tell whether it succeeded. Second, after each of the first two 
  calls, a new token has to be acquired. Finally, if a failure occurs after new 
  token have been taken, those tokens have to be &quot;put back&quot; so they 
  can be reused by some other rule. The resultant code is somewhat cluttered, 
  though not particularly complex:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>boolean assignment(Token tok) {
    Token tok2, tok3;
 
    if (variable(tok)) {
        tok2 = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    if (equalsSign(tok2)) {
        tok3 = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        tokenizer.pushBack(tok2);
        return false;
    }
    if (expression(tok3)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        tokenizer.pushBack(tok3); // notice order of pushBacks
        tokenizer.pushBack(tok2);
        return false;
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this pattern occurs frequently, we can simplify the code if our <code>Tokenizer</code> class
  has a way to &quot;back up&quot; and give us the same Tokens over again. This can be
  done either by having the Tokenizer 
  class keep track of the last several tokens that it has returned, or by keeping
  track of the Tokens ourselves, and telling the Tokenizer class to take back
  those Tokens. For now, let's assume that the Tokenizer has a <code>pushBack(<i>int</i>)</code> method
  to reuse the most recent <i><code>int</code></i> 
  tokens. Moreover, since we always return <code>false</code> after calling <code>pushBack</code>,
   we can simplify our code ever further by having <code>pushBack</code> itself
    return <code>false</code>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>boolean assignment(Token tok) { 
    if (variable(tok)) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    if (equalsSign(tok)) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return tokenizer.pushBack(1);
    }
    if (expression(tok)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return tokenizer.pushBack(2);
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  There is a further problem, in that sometimes we may not know exactly how many 
  tokens have been consumed, and must be returned. Consider the following BNF:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;something&gt; ::= &lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If &lt;foo&gt; is recognized but &lt;bar&gt; is not, we must replace the (unknown)
   number of tokens recognized by &lt;foo&gt;. This can be handled by having
   the  Tokenizer class keep a count of the number of tokens read, and the ability
   to reuse  tokens back to a given token number. Thus, the above code could
   be represented  by something like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>boolean something(Token tok) {
    int oldTokenCount = tokenizer.getTokenCount();
    if (foo(tok)) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    if (bar(tok)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return tokenizer.pushBack(tokenizer.getTokenCount() - oldTokenCount);
    }
}
        </pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sequencing and Alternation</h3>
<p>Sequencing combined with alternation is, in most cases, simply handled.
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;integer&gt; ::= &lt;unsigned integer&gt; |  &quot;-&quot; &lt;unsigned integer&gt;

boolean unsignedInteger(Token tok) {
    if (number(tok)) return true;

    if (if (tok.value.equals(&quot;-&quot;))) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    if (number(tok)) return true;
    } else {
        return tokenizer.pushBack(1);
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Living without <code>pushBack</code></h3>
<p>If we have a Tokenizer without adequate <code>pushBack</code> facilities,
  it is almost always better to wrap that Tokenizer in a &quot;front end&quot; class of
  our own that provides these facilities. But if we only need pushBack in a very
  few places, sometimes it is better to modify the grammar so as to avoid the
  need for reusing Tokens.</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; &quot;+&quot; &lt;expression&gt; | &lt;term&gt; &quot;-&quot; &lt;expression&gt;
    | &lt;term&gt;</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without pushBack, if we find a &lt;term&gt; but don't find a &quot;+&quot; after it, we can't
  put back the &lt;term&gt; for use in another alternative. However, the problem goes
  away entirely if we rewrite the grammar slightly:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; &lt;expression extender&gt;<br>
    <br>
  &lt;expression extender&gt; ::= &quot;+&quot; &lt;expression&gt; | &quot;-&quot; &lt;expression&gt; | &lt;empty&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Direct Recursion</h3>
<p>Many BNF rules are recursive: Statements can contain statements, and expressions 
  can contain expressions. For a first example, though, we will use something 
  simpler: an &quot;unsigned integer.&quot; The idea here is that an integer contains 
  other integers, as for example the integer <code>12345</code> contains the integer 
  <code>345</code>. In practice, of course, recognizing an integer would be done 
  by the tokenizer, not by the parser.</p>
<p>There are four obvious recursive ways to define an unsigned integer, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>// left recursive, base case first<br>
    &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;unsigned integer&gt; &lt;digit&gt;</code></p>
  <p><code>// right recursive, base case first<br>
    &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; &lt;unsigned integer&gt;</code></p>
  <p><code>// left recursive, base case last<br>
    &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;unsigned integer&gt;&lt;digit&gt; | &lt;digit&gt;</code></p>
  <p><code>// right recursive, base case last<br>
    &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt;&lt;unsigned integer&gt; | &lt;digit&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When writing a recursive program, it is generally a good idea to put the base 
  cases first. However, in this case, that strategy does not work. Our recursive 
  method for &lt;unsigned integer&gt; would begin like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>boolean unsignedInteger(Token tok) {
    if (tok.type == Token.DIGIT) return true;
    ...
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, with this code, the second and subsequent digits would never be recognized. 
  This suggests an important principle:</p>
<div align="center">
  <table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8">
    <tr> 
      <td>If one alternative is an initial substring of another alternative, the 
        longer alternative should be attempted first.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br>
</div>
<p>Left recursion has an even worse problem. A left-recursive method would begin 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>
boolean unsignedInteger(Token tok) {
    if (unsignedInteger(tok)) {
        ...
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Any time a recursive call is made with exactly the same parameter values as 
  the calling method, the result is an &quot;infinite&quot; recursion. Depending 
  on the implementation, such a program will either hang or will terminate abnormally. 
  This suggests a second important principle:</p>
<div align="center"> 
  <table width="75%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8">
    <tr> 
      <td>Avoid left recursion!</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br>
</div>
<p>This leaves us with trying to define an unsigned integer with a right-recursive 
  program, with the base case last:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>// &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt;&lt;unsigned integer&gt; | &lt;digit&gt;

boolean unsignedInteger(Token tok) {

    // first case: &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt;&lt;unsigned integer&gt;
    if (tok.type == Token.DIGIT) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    if (unsignedInteger(tok)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        tokenizer.pushBack(1);
        tok = currentToken();
    }

    // second case: &lt;unsigned integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt;
    if (tok.type == Token.DIGIT) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When the first case in the above code fails, we restore everything to the way 
  it was on method entry, before going on to the second case. This involves putting 
  back the tokens we consumed in the failed attempt, and resetting the tok variable 
  to what it was upon method entry.</p>
<p>The above code could be somewhat simplified, but at the moment we are concerned 
  with describing a fairly mechanical way of turning BNF into code.</p>
<h3>Indirect Recursion</h3>
<p>Usually recursion involves two or more rules, as for example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;statement&gt; ::= ... | &lt;if statement&gt; | ...
&lt;if statement&gt; ::= if ( &lt;condition&gt; ) &lt;statement&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither of these rules is recursive in itself, but each refers to the other, 
  and together they form an indirect recursion. Usually, nothing special must 
  be done to handle indirect recursion; the only case to avoid is when the very 
  first element of each nonterminal is the other nonterminal, so that together 
  the rules form an infinite recursion. This is very unlikely to occur in practice.</p>
<h3>Optional Elements</h3>
<p>Although not present in original BNF, Extended BNF (EBNF) allows optional elements, 
  enclosed in brackets. Thus, for example, the following indicates that the <code>&lt;else 
  part&gt;</code> is optional:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;if statement&gt; ::= &lt;if part&gt; [ &lt;else part&gt; ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be implemented quite easily. All we need do is attempt to parse the 
  optional element, and return true whether or not the parse succeeds.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>boolean ifStatement(Token tok) {
    if (ifPart(tok)) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    elsePart(tok); // ignore result
    return true;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>
Repeated Elements
</h3>
<p>EBNF also allows zero or more repetitions of an element, enclosed in braces.
  For example,
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;list&gt; ::= &lt;item&gt; { &quot;,&quot; &lt;item&gt; }</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is, a &lt;list&gt; consists of one or more &lt;item&gt;s, separated by
  commas. This construction is best handled with a loop, rather than with recursion.
<blockquote>
  <pre>boolean list(Token tok) {
    if (item(tok)) {
        tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
        while (tok.value.equals(&quot;,&quot;)) {
            tok = tokenizer.nextToken();
            if (!item(tok)) error();
        }
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>EBNF adds no expressive power to BNF; that is, any grammar that can be written
  with EBNF could also be written with just BNF. However, just as EBNF makes
  it simpler to write grammars, it also makes it easier to write recognizers
  for those grammars. </p>
